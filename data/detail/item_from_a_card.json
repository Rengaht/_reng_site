The blessings can be given to their family, their friends, or even themselves, to reconnect the relationship between people, and find the rhythm of life for the new year.\nThe cards are designed by us, made by hand-printing, or by developing photos in darkroom."

I go swimming quite often, and I like to look at people nearby floating in different ways. Everyone may have his/her own techniques of swimming, but all of them seem to be free and comfortable.\n\n\n手繪圖稿經過電腦處理後，雷射切割出壓克力的模板，在以顏料印製在卡紙上。\nThe hand-drawn picture is processed in computer to use laser cutting to make acrylic template, on which we then use ink to print on paper."
